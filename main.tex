\section{Introduction}
In recent years, the design of business visualizations has gained significant attention due to its impact on user comprehension and memory. Theoretical frameworks from cognitive psychology and visual cognition provide a robust foundation for understanding how viewers process visual data. This document outlines key theories that support the study of how elements such as color, shape, position, and content affect comprehension and recall in business-oriented data visualizations.

\section{Dual-Coding Theory}
Proposed by Paivio (1986), the dual-coding theory suggests that information is stored in both verbal and visual codes. This dual representation enhances memory and comprehension. Applying this theory to business visualizations, combining textual labels with meaningful visual elements can significantly improve the user's ability to understand and retain information \parencite{paivio1986}.

\section{Gestalt Principles of Perception}
Gestalt psychology posits that humans naturally perceive visual elements as organized patterns or wholes rather than separate components. Principles such as proximity, similarity, closure, and continuity influence how visual information is grouped and interpreted \parencite{koffka1935}. In the context of dashboards, these principles can guide the layout to support intuitive grouping and faster comprehension.

\section{Pre-Attentive Processing}
Certain visual attributes—such as color, shape, orientation, and size—are processed pre-attentively, meaning they are registered in memory before conscious attention is allocated \parencite{healey1996}. This is crucial in business contexts, where highlighting key metrics using pre-attentive features can accelerate user interpretation.

\section{Visual Search: Shape and Color}
Research on visual search performance has shown that shape and color combinations significantly affect how quickly and accurately users locate information. For example, square shapes tend to yield faster detection times than rounded shapes when paired with certain colors \parencite{abdurrahman2023}. These findings can inform design guidelines for dashboard elements.

\section{Eye-Tracking in Visualization Research}
Eye-tracking methodologies offer empirical evidence of how users navigate visualizations. Studies have revealed patterns in gaze behavior that reflect cognitive load, search strategies, and attention distribution \parencite{burch2017}. Applying these techniques to business dashboards enables designers to identify bottlenecks or misleading layouts.

\section{Visual Cognition and Mental Imagery}
Stephen Kosslyn's work emphasizes that visual cognition involves both spatial and object-based representations. Mental imagery plays a critical role in interpreting graphs, maps, and complex figures \parencite{kosslyn1994}. Understanding how users mentally process business visuals can lead to better-informed layout and encoding strategies.
